## Overview
Church On App ("the App") is a multi-tenant platform used by churches to facilitate community engagement, content sharing, giving, interchurch activities, messaging, and games. The App is operated under the domain `churchapp.cloud` (subject to change). This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, how it is shared, and your choices.

## Data we collect
- Account data: email, display name, profile image
- Memberships: your association with one or more churches and roles (guest/user/admin/superAdmin)
- Content interactions: sermons viewed, events RSVP, chat messages, announcements/news/report submissions
- Device/app data: basic device info, crash reports, notifications tokens
- Payments metadata: giving amounts, method, service references, transaction status, fees; we do not store card or wallet PINs
- Games data: local scores; optional global leaderboard entries if you opt in

## Why we collect data
- Provide and improve features: auth, content, messaging, payments, games, analytics
- Security and integrity: detect abuse, troubleshooting, crash diagnostics
- Legal and financial compliance: payment records, fees, audit trails
- Communication: notifications and service updates

## Data sharing
- Service providers: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging, Crashlytics), payment processors (MTN, Airtel, PayPal)
- Churches: admins of your church can access relevant church data (e.g., tithes dashboard, reports)
- Interchurch activities: participating church admins may access shared activity metadata
- Legal: when required by law or to protect users and the platform

We do not sell your personal data.

## Payments
Payments are processed via third-party providers. We store transaction metadata (amount, method, references, status) to enable receipts and accounting. Sensitive payment credentials are handled by the provider, not stored by us.

## Global Leaderboard (Opt-in)
Players may opt in to participate in a global leaderboard. If opted in, you may choose to appear as "Anonymous" or display your name. You can opt out by declining the opt-in the next time you submit a score.

## Data retention
- Accounts and church data are retained while your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter for legal and audit purposes
- You may request deletion of your account; certain records (e.g., payment ledgers) may be retained where legally required

## Security
- Firebase security rules limit read/write based on role and membership
- Sensitive operations restricted to admins/superadmins
- TLS for data-in-transit; provider-side storage protections

## Your choices
- Access and update your profile information
- Opt in/out of the global leaderboard per score submission
- Control notifications at the OS/app level
- Request data deletion via support

## Children’s privacy
The App is intended for use by churches and their communities. Where required, parental/guardian consent must be obtained by participating churches for minors.

## Changes
We may update this policy. Material changes will be communicated in-app or via email. Continued use constitutes acceptance.
